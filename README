BLE Application Software for the Velo Bling-Bling Project
*********************************************************

LED lights for bicycle wheels.
16 multi color LEDs on each side (PCB top- and bottom side).
There are two windows (upper and lower) on each side for display
dynamic information like speed, trip time, trip distance, etc. or
static information like strings and images.
The windows have a resolution of 100 x 16 pixels.
The space between the windows can be filled with a pattern/image
(AKA blingbling).

This application software runs on the BL600/BL652 Module (BLE slave) and 
communicates over the UART and I2C interface with the main MCU (MK22DX256VLF5).

BLE Master (e.g. Smart Phone) <-> BLE Slave BL652 UART & I2C <-> main MCU

The BLE Master can use the propriarity vSP Bridge Mode to communicate over the
UART with the main MCU like a serial terminal (Command Line Interface CLI). The
Cycling Speed and Cadence Service (CSC) is a standard Bluetooth service, data
are exchanged between main MCU and BL600/BL652 by I2C.

The USB CDC on the main MCU can be used as a terminal interface for the 
BL600/BL652 module. You can use the UwTerminalX for communicating and 
downloading applications onto Laird's BL600/BL652 module.
